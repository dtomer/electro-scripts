# electro-scripts

A bunch of scripts to help me with data analysis of gaussian data. Mostly python/perl

Some of them depends on the installation of other scripts: in particular, openbabel/pybel python modules.

Whenever a QTAIM calculation is performed, it requires the Promega/ProAIM scripts from Carlo Gatti. Charges and spin can also be interfaced with the MultiWFN code.

TO ADD: 
  1. basic suroutine for reading from GINC summary of gaussian. 
  2. Data folder for the machine-dependent submission routines
  3. Better handling of errors
  4. Some explanation of how code work?
  
    4.1 integration of code to handle options (cleaner?)
    4.2 Moving to python?
